# Automatebound: Easy modded server setup
Automatebound is a tool for setting up and constantly updating a modded starbound server with your own personal workshop collection!
Automatebound interfaces directly with the steam workshop through steamcmd, and will automatically update your modded server on a set interval. it uses a caching system alongside nodejs to reduce mod updating downtime for your server! It will also handle initial setup of your modded server alongside your designated steam workshop collection.

## TO GET STARTED:
First make sure you install SteamCMD inside of the main directory for this automation script by running steamcmd.exe inside of the SteamCMD folder.
A copy of it is included in this project, but feel free to grab your own copy on steam's website
Install nodejs
Install python 3
Make sure you have powershell installed as well if you are using some other system (WARNING: UNTESTED IN LINUX, DON'T EVEN TRY TO USE A MAC)
there was an issue that occured when microsoft word was not installed alongside powershel, but that issue is resolved.
Open up AAA_STARTSERVER_AAA and edit the file to direct to your Autoupdate.js file
Open up Autoupdater.js, and edit to what you need it to do!

This application is still in beta, but has worked from my personal tests and I have used it to run my server, evil penguin!
